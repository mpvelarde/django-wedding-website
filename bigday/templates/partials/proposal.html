                God bless Daniel McKinnon. After three proposal attempts, all foiled by Tori,
                Dan proposed after a stressful day spent moving into their first apartment together.
                Dan frequently likes to relive the moment by proposing on random mountain tops.
                Good news, Tori has said yes every time.
